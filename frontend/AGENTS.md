# Frontend AGENTS.md - ODH Dashboard

This document provides frontend-specific guidance for AI agents working on the ODH Dashboard frontend application.

## Required Context

**IMPORTANT**: Before working on frontend tasks, agents MUST read the parent directory's AGENTS.md file located at `../AGENTS.md` to gain essential repository context, structure, and general guidelines.

## Speckit Artifacts

All speckit artifacts and configurations are located in the `frontend/.specify/` folder. This includes:
- specs
- memory
- scripts
- templates

When working with speckit commands or artifacts, always reference the `.specify/` directory within the frontend folder.

## Frontend-Specific Guidelines

For frontend-specific development patterns and conventions, refer to the main repository AGENTS.md file in the parent directory.
